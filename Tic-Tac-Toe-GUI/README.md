# Tic Tac Toe GUI

This is the world-known 2 player game [Tic Tac Toe](), but this time it's the **GUI** version. <br>


I say "this time" because some time ago I made the Tic Tac Toe game but in a [text-based version](https://github.com/henrique-efonseca/Portfolio/tree/master/Tic-Tac-Toe). <br>
The reason why I decided to make this game is basically the same as when I was making the text-based version, I'm learning **Java** in [College](https://github.com/henrique-efonseca/College-Projects) and I wanted to put the knowledge I had so far to the test and develop something. So I decided to make the Tic Tac Toe game but this time in an improved version (GUI). <br>
At this point, I had not learned anything about GUI in College so this was my first time ever developing a project with a GUI. With this, I had to learn by myself about **GUI** in general and **Java Swing** (searching online and using video tutorials). <br>


This game isn't perfect but I had fun creating it and, most importantly, it allowed me to **learn** something with it (**Java Swing** and **GUI**). <br>

## Game Screenshots

The rules of the game are simple, alternately each Player clicks with the mouse on a House to play (Houses are represented in a [3][3] JButton Matrix).
The player who plays in 3 consecutive Houses (vertically, horizontally or perpendicular) wins the game.
If every House is filled without this happening it's consider a Tie. <br>
After the game ends it restarts automatically. <br> <br>

Basically the Tic Tac Toe normal rules.
Here are some screenshots of the game that are very self-explanatory:
