				INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In this galaxy and not far far away from Earth, a young Jedi is lost 
and trapped in a galactic maze.

To escape this maze and get back to his ETI friends at Iscte, he needs to
solve some problems and puzzles	...

With your help and some R2-D2, he will finally be able to escape and go home! 



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				  CONTROLS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


KEYBOARD:

Left, Right, Up, Down           - fly through the maze



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		                 OBJECTIVE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The game has several levels. By simply puting every R2-D2 in the targets
(rebel symbol) you complete the level. Once they are on the targets
they will change their color to red.

If you run out of Force you won't be able to move and the level will restart.

The fewer moves you make to complete a level, the higher your score will be.


--


In the maze several things may appear:

- Obstacles                  - They can't harm you or do anything, 
(like Droids                   they are just obstacles. You can get rid
or Mandalorians)               of them by throwing them to the black hole.


- Black Hole                 - Don't fall into one or throw a R2-D2 to it
			       or the level will restart.

- Yoda                       - The Jedi Master Yoda will may appear if you
			       run out of Force and need help to recover it.
 
- Oil                        - Be careful with the oil, you will slip.


- Red Hole                   - When you enter in a Red Hole, you will be teleported to the other one.


- Chewbacca                  - Chewie is a friend for life! When you found him, he will help you destroing Grey Walls.


Notes:
- If you throw a Mandalorian into the black hole you will replace it for a wall.
- If two movable objects are in a row you cannot push any of them in that
same direction.
- In the end of each SokobanGame, each player can see his last points in each level in a text file with his username.
- You cannot pass trough walls.
