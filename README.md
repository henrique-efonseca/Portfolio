# Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my **Portfolio**!

My name is **Henrique Fonseca** and I'm a **Telecommunications and Computer Engineering** student. <br>
Here I will keep track of every project that I've made. Keep in mind that you may find projects more professional than others because some projects were made with the intention of learning something new (like a programming language/technology) or just for fun. <br>
<br>
The idea of this Portfolio is to document/organize my projects and to keep track of my progress and evolution throughout the years.
